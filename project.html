    <dt> <b>Automatic Led Blinking Circuit Using 555 Timer</b></dt>
    <dd>The 555 timerIC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation, and
        oscillator applications.Here you can change the flashing speed of LED by changing the capacitor with different
        capacitance.If you want to add more LEDs in this flashing LED circuit, connect them parallel with the first LED
        using proper resistors.</dd>
        <dt><b>Clap Switch</b></dt>
        <dd>This switch activates once or twice clapped & deactivates when again clapped once based on the design
            of the circuit. A circuited which operatesthrough clap sound otherwise similar to that sound is called clap switch.Thisswitch activates once or twice clapped & deactivates when again clapped once based on the design
            of the circuit.</dd>
            <dt><b>Image Threshloding using image processing</b></dt>
            <dd>Image thresholding is a simple, yet effective, way of partitioning an image into a foreground and background. This image analysis technique is a type of image segmentation that isolates objects by converting grayscale images into binary images. Image thresholding is most effective in images with high levels of contrast.</dd>
